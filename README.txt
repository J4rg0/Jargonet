Jargonet Portfolio Page
I started with an HTML5UP template and began modifying it to suit my own purposes while keeping the general design intact. The site is responsive and I've begun playing around with adding more advanced features such as a floating navbar.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, HTML5 UP

When I first began working with the template I found the html very accessible, but the real challenges began when I started digging into the CSS. The templates include a lot of customizable options, a decent amount that are optional and not used in the layout. I learned quite a bit once I tried dissecting the CSS and modifying it it personalize the site further.

I also began using JS to add more functionality to the site and plan to add more.

Optimizations
(optional)

You don't have to include this section but interviewers love that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are GREAT to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

Lessons Learned:
I learned a lot about more complex and intricate CSS methods and I'm sure I will continue to do so as I further customize and play with my website. I've also only begun to scratch the surface of JS functionality.
